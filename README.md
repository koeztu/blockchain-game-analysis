# Analysis of finite blockchain games, the rational strategy

A work-in-progress Python implementation for our analysis. 

## What we can
- Calculate payoff-matrices for any blockchain and any game lengtt T.
- Verify that the equilibrium path never leads to a fork for any game length T.

## What is next?
- Test if a miner ever (off-path) switches to a shorter branch.
- Test if a miner ever (off-path) ever switches away from a branch they already won a block on.
