    "The first two functions, `pickWinners()` and `pickParents()`, are exclusively used to test basic functionality of the blockchain classes (they are only used in `tests.ipynb`). They randomly pick a winner among the miners for every stage of a $T$-stage game, as well as a parent for every block. This can then be used to generate a random blockchain, allowing us to see if the code behaves as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `drawChain()` allows us to look at the structure of the blockchain in console output. This makes visualizing what is going on a lot easier. Next, we have two quality-of-life functions called `timeElapsed()` and `printPayoffMatrix()`, which make printing passed time and payoff-matrices to the output a lot simpler. Finally, we have the function `isOnSameBranch()`. It simply checks whether two blocks $b$ and $c$ are on the same branch or not. \n"
