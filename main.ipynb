    "* When the output says that it checked all situations for height $h$, it means that for all possible situations at the beginning of stage $t=h+1$, the conjecture was not violated in any of the subsequent intermediate stages $t,\\dots,T$. A block’s height is equal to its index, which is equal to the stage it was mined in.\n",

This also means that we can skip the two-stage game, because we know what the Nash equilibrium in the second stage of the two-stage game looks like, and that it does not violate any conjectures."
