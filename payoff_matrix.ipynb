    "The function $finalExpectedPayoff()$ makes use of the blockchain class method $getPayoff()$ to calculate the payoff for miner $i$ over the longest chains. That is, it computes the expected value for miner $i$ when Nature chooses one of the longest chains at random.   \n",

    "Next, we have the function $matrixNashEq()$. It finds the Nash equilibria of a payoff matrix. That payoff matrix may be generated by $finalPayoffMatrix()$ or $intermediatePayoffMatrix()$, both work. Finally, the function $getStrategies()$ returns the strategies of all miners in every Nash equilibrium.\n",
