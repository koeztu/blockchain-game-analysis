    "This notebook runs some tests to verify that our code is working as intended. It was used a lot during development to iron out bugs. It is important to note that testing in our case is not trivial. The best we can do is to check that the code works properly for games with $T=2$ and $T=3$ stages and trust in our ability to write code that generalizes to any number of stages. However, basic functionality like constructing and extending the blockchain is easily verified."
